Working with links Inode - data structur that contains all info of a file and it is unique

    to find it it is ls -i
    use stat command on a file to display inode data

Hard Links

    files that contain data of the hard drive
    data on any link will not be deleted unless all the links are
    to create a hard link its ln file ~Downloads/fileHL

Soft Links

    it shows other files instead of data in the hard drive
    these are more easier to modify than hard links
    to create a symbolic link its ln -s file fileSL

Using Wildcards

    wildcards are used to represent or replace letters in a filename

the "*" can match anything or nothing and is able to match any number of characters

    benefits when you forget the file name but remember the extension or look for all files that end with the same extension
    "ls *.txt" will match all files that end with .txt regarless of size or any other factors

the "?" can only match one character

    can be used when looking for hidden files
    to list all hidden files: ls .??*

it is not the same as using * as . is current directory and .. is previous but it can work if its ./.* or ../.* to match files in either current or parent directory

the "[]" wildcard is used to match characters in range

    if an exclamation point is used, it is to exclude whats inside the brackets
    to match all files whose name does not have a number in it
        ls [!0-9].
    to match all files that beins with a letter from a-p or starts with the letters s or c
        ls [a-psc]*
    to mach all files whos name begins with an y 3 combination of numbers
        ls [0-9][0-9][0-9]$USER

Brace Expansion

    it is not a wildcard but is another feature of bash that allows arbiturary strings to be attached
    screenshot example from PPT slide

mkdir -p music/{jazz,rock/{mp3files,videos,oggfile}}/new tree music/
