Virtualization

    A replication of hardware to simualte a virtual machine inside a physical machine
    Two Types of Virtualization:
        Server-side virtualization
        Client-side virtualization

Server-side Virtualization Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

    Thick/fath client
    Thin client
    Zero client

Client-sidee Virtualization

    Software that can be installed on a computer to manage virtul machines
    VMs can have their own OS installed
    To be able to run a client-side virtualization:
    Hypervisor
        hardware support
            capable cpu
            enough ram
            enough storage

Type 1 vs Type 2 Hypervisor Type 1

    runs on hardware
        VMware ESX and ESXi
        Citrix XenServer

Type 2

    runs on a host operating system
        VMware
        Oracle VirtualBox

Benefits of Virtualization

    Can run multiple OSs on one machine
    Allows applications to be tested before installing them onto the host machine
    Reduces costs by decreasing the physical hardware needed that get purchased on a network
    allows access to experiment with any untested programs without directly damaging the host machines

VirtualBox

    A type 2 virtualization product for enterprise/home use
    Runs on:
        Windows
        Linux
        Macintosh
        Solaris

VMWare Workstation Player

    Free of charge, type 2
    free version of Workstation but is restricted
    Available nn Linux and Windows
    Can support a big amount of guest OSs

Requirements for Computer Virtualization

    AMD V or INTEL V compatible processor
    Dual core x64 processor with 1.3 GHz or faster 4GB of RAM
    Enough free hard drive space for installing guest OSs

Using Virtualbox

    Step 1: download the current version of Viirtualbox
    Step 2: go to where it says "new" and create a machine
        have it have ubuntu in the name so Virtualbox can automatically recognize that the OS that is to be downloaded is of Ubuntu
    put whatever MB of ram that the OS can use, recommeded 4 MB of ram
        In the settings where it says System the base memory is also where you can edit the amount of MB that can be used from the ram.
    next would be making sure it is a VDI machine
    after you would proceed to put the amount of storage the VM would need, recommended 2-4 GB or at least 1/4 of what the actual computer has

Powerpoint 3 Installing Ubuntu 20.04

    start the virtual machine and make sure it has Ubuntu in the name so that it can immediantly recognize it will be an Ubuntu VM
    recommended 2 GB of ram or at least 4 MB if it is for just 1 VM
    Next click, Create a virtual hard disk now, which indicates any size can be used
    Next would be VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image), which formats the image
    Dynamically allocated isn't as bothersome and will use actual storage from the hard drive
    recommended GB for Ubuntu is 25 GB
    in General settings after completing you would go in and make sure it has bidirectional selected. It allows ability to copy and paste between Guest and User.
    Only give your VM a good quantity of RAM
    the amount the host CPU to Virtual CPU should be unlimited
    The virtual graphics card can also be selected to the amount of memory provided.
    IDE controller would be where the Optical disks are attached, they would be downloaded in the physical computers folders
    after everything has been set up, user can proceed to click start and wait for the OS to boot up.
    click start
    click install ubuntu
    Will be prompted to the Welcome Screen
        pick main language the VM will use
        normal installation, download updates + install third party much be checked.
        next click erase disk
        next will be prompted to click ok because the partitions will be formatted
        after you may pick where you are in the world
        following this, you will be prompted to put in basic user information like computer name and user/passwords
    after installation is complete, it will prompt you to restart the VM

Class preparations Ubuntu Software update : sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt full-upgrade -y

or sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

or... do this all on one single line: sudo apt install curl -y; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/guides/oneliner.sh | bash

What is a Raspberry Pi? A raspberry pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs in to a monitor or Tv and can use a regular keyboard and mouse. It is a tiny computer that functions as a regular desktop

    The main components needed to use a raspberry pi would be:
        The raspberry Pi itself
        the Pi Case
        Pi Power Supply
        Micro SD
        HDMI Cable
    You would need to use an imager to download whatever OS is needed into the raspberry Pi on the Micro SD

Working with Raspberry Pi OS

    The steps that are included in the welcome screen of the Raspberry Pi OS is
        Click next to get started
        Set the country and language
        set a password
        connect raspberry pi to the wifi
        the software will be updated and checked before using
        onces it's done, the wizard will restart the OS and have it running

Different Operating Systems for the Raspberry Pi

    Ubuntu
    Kali Linux
    Diet Pi
    Arch Linux
    Elementary OS
    Manjaro
    Windows 10
    Android
